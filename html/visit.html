          <div class="question">Do you accept Visa/Debit?</div>
          <p class="answer">We accept tap visa/debit and cash. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we prefer that you pay with visa/debit this year.</p>

      <div class="box  col-12 col-md-6">
          <div class="question">Is your produce organic?</div>
          <p class="answer">Our crops are grown using sustainable agriculture principles to ensure that our land remains viable for future generations. We practice integrated pest management and regularly monitor our fields for insects and disease, only using pest control products when they are necessary. We are not an organic farm.</p>

          <div class="question">Is there anything my kids to do at your farm?</div>
          <p class="answer">Yes! Berry picking! Our farm is small and simple, so for that reason, we do not have any large kid-oriented attractions. The farm is a beautiful place to come enjoy an afternoon picking berries, enjoying the sun, spending time together as a family, and teaching your kids about how food is grown!.</p>

          <div class="question">Is there a bathroom and handwashing stations on the farm?</div>

            <div class="question">Should I bring my own buckets?</div>
            <p class="answer">Yes! Feel free to bring your own buckets or containers to pick into. We will weigh them before you go into the field and deduct the weight of the containers when you pay for your berries. We also have buckets or flats available to purchase for $2 each.

            <div class="question">Is there a fee to pick in your fields?</div>
            <p class="answer">Nope! We don't feel that we need to charge for you to pick berries. All we respectfully ask is that you pay for all your berries - this means not eating fruit in the fields, but only eating the fruit after you've paid for it. :)

      <h3 class="subheading">U-Picking Etiquette</h3>
      <h4>We ask u-pickers to follow these guidelines to help create an enjoyable atmosphere for everyone!</h4>


      <div class="etiquetteContainer">
       
        <ol>
            <li>Check in with staff before picking. We can tell you where the best picking spots are!</li>
            <li>Come prepared! It can get very hot in the fields as there is little shade. Please bring water, sunscreen, and a hat!</li>

            <li>Wash your hands before picking berries. </li>

            <li>Please do not eat fruit in the fields. We know it is SO tempting. But think of the field like a grocery store. Would you eat food in the produce section before paying for it? Probably not. It's kinda the same thing. :)</li>

            <li>Only pick in rows designated for u-picking. Some rows are designated for our hired pickers only, or to allow the berries to ripen further.</li>

            <li>Even though we love pets, we cannot allow them in the fields for food safety reasons.</li>

            <li>No outside foods/picnicking allowed in the fields.</li>

            <li>No smoking anywhere on the farm.</li>

      <div>This year we are taking extra precautions as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. Read below to find out how we are doing our part to curb the spread.
      We are doing our best to follow the guidelines of the BCCDC, WCB, and the Public Health Officer. If you notice us doing something (or not doing something) that you don't think is following these guidelines, please feel free to call and ask us about it! All these changes are new to us at the farm and we gladly accept your feedback during this transition. </div>


        <div class="covid-19-uPick-title">U-Pick</div>
        <p class="covid-19-uPick-description">We will be asking our u-pickers to follow the rules of the farm in order to be safe and stay healthy while on the farm. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Please stay home if you are feeling ill. </li>
            
            <li>Stay 6 feet apart from others. Please be respectful, and give people lots of space. If you are finished picking in a berry row and do not have enough space to walk back through the row without maintaining a 6-foot distance between other customers, please exit the row at the far side of the property and walk back along the side of the field. </li>
            
            <li>Check in with staff before going into the field. They will show you where to pick. </li>

            <li>
            Wash your hands before going into the field and maintain good hygiene while picking. Avoid touching your face after you have washed your hands. Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. There are various handwashing stations located around the farm.   
            </li>

            <li>Please do not touch any fruit that you donâ€™t intend on picking.</li>
            
            <li>Families, including children, must stay together with their family unit and try to minimize contact with other customers and staff. </li>
            
        </ol>
            
            <p>We will be monitoring the farm closely to ensure that customers have enough space to be able to maintain an adequate physical distance from others.</p>

    <div class="covid-19-employee-Container">
        <div class="covid-19-employee-title">Employee</div>
        <p class="covid-19-employee-description">This year we have new policies and procedures in place to keep our farm safe and healthy for both employees and customers. These policies were created based on recommendations made by the Ministry of Agriculture, BCCDC, and BC Public Health Officer. 
         We will be increasing the frequency of hand-hygiene and sanitization of high-touch surfaces such as the check-out area, scales, and bathroom. We are requiring our employees to maintain physical distancing whenever it is possible. If physical distancing is not possible, we will be requiring face-shields to be worn, and for our employees to work in small designated teams. Employees who are picking berries for orders are trained on proper hand-hygiene and glove use. Our staff is encouraged to stay home if they have any symptoms of COVID-19, even if very mild.
