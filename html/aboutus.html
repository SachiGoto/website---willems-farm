Here they built a small farmhouse, and raised their 8 children. They grew raspberries on this land for almost 40 years. Then in the mid 80’s, Clarence and Hilda’s son, Jack, and his wife Irene moved onto the farm. Jack and Irene have grown raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries for 35 years on the farm.
